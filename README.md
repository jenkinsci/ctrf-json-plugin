## What is CTRF?

Common Test Report Format (CTRF) is a JSON test report schema that provides standardized JSON test results reports.

*Consistency Across Tools:* Different testing tools and frameworks often produce reports in varied formats. CTRF provides a common schema, making it easy to understand and compare reports, regardless of the testing tool used.

*Language and Framework Agnostic:* A universal reporting schema that works seamlessly with any programming language and testing framework.

*Facilitates Enhanced Programmatic Use:* Programatically interacting with test outcomes across multiple tools becomes more straightforward.
